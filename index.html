					<p>Everywhere Australia consists of four distinct personalities:</p>
				
					<ol>
						<li> <a href="https://meghancatterick.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Meghan Catterick</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://hackerman24816.github.io/Intro-to-IT-A1/ " target="_blank">Vincent Chieu</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://1jasoner1.github.io/" target="_blank">Jason Samaan</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://niedzko.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Konrad Niedzwiedz</a></li>
					<p></p>
					</ol>
					<p>We all come from diverse backgrounds and experience levels, bringing a unique blend of attributes to our collective team.
					<p>Meghan recently relocation to Australia from the UK and is looking to immerse herself into the IT industry. Having a strong background in IT recruitment, she has a unique perspective into the skills and experience required to succeed in this industry. She brings a project management background and tenacity to get the job done - as demonstrated by her undefeated boxing career!</p>
					<p>Vincent is from a Chinese and Vietnamese family and brings the creative flair to our group. His love of music and abilities as a piano player demonstrate his abilities to work independently and to progressively build his skills. He brings a natural curiosity and passion to all he does.</p>
					<p>Jason is the big-picture thinker of the team and is called to a greater purpose, as is demonstrated by his volunteer work. While he is a visionary and can see the big picture, he also likes to bring his team mates on the journey and enjoyed watching them reach their full potential. A great team-player.</p>
					<p>Konrad brings a wealth of experience in IT sales and business development. He looks for purpose in his work and likes to go about his business with integrity. Although introverted, he enjoys deep connections and can provide insightful advice when called upon. He is also a budding musician and enjoys creative endeavours. </p>
					<p>Assuming the accuracy of the Myers Briggs personality profiles, we are indeed a well-rounded team with personal attributes that complement each other. With two Diplomats, a Sentinel and an Explorer, we cover three of the four high-level MBTI roles with the Analyst the only omission. However, with Meghan as our resident Logistician, we have someone who thrives in facts and structure. Among us we bring a healthy balance of structure, creativity, harmony and strategic thinking to ensure team success.</p>

					<h2>Account Technology Strategist</h2>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>In the broader IT world, the people I admire the most are the ones that are not only on the cutting edge of new technology, but also understand the ethical and philosophical implications. These are the people that are thought leaders and actively contribute to the betterment of society through the ethical use of technology.</p>
					<p>I have also learnt that purpose is something I need for my work to be fulfilling. For me, this usually comes when in services to others. I enjoy learning as much as I can about new technology and using that knowledge to help others. Any role that involves thought leadership and evangelising technology usually means being a leader in that particular field. I seek to have enough knowledge and experience in my chosen field to be that expert – not to satisfy my ego, but to help others solve their problems and achieve their goals. I believe I would seek this type of role regardless of my chosen industry.</p>
					<p>It is for this reason I have chosen a Technology Strategist with Microsoft, a role that is positioned as the expert in its field, as my ideal job in IT. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have</h3>
					<p>With my existing experience, I have non-technical skills required to succeed in such a broad role. I believe I have the leadership and people management skills needed. I am able build relationships, establish trust and listen to a customer’s requirements in order to translate them into strategic initiatives. Technical sales is listed as key requirement, and this has been my core function for the past decade.</p>
					<h3>Skills I Need</h3>
					<p>I need more learning in computer science and cloud technologies. Experience in specific industry solutions such as Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and modernising application architecture is also something I would need to learn.</p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>After completing my Bachelor of IT degree, I will need to shift my career to working at Microsoft and start on the consulting journey. I believe on the job experience will be as, if not more, important than academic achievement for this type of role. Work experience will be augmented with ongoing learning & development in emerging fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, blockchain, etc.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>

			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, a grand desire to make the world a better place is reflected in the Myers-Briggs personality test. According to the results of this test I am an Advocate personalist type, my role is that of the Diplomat with a strategy for Constant Improvement. Below is a graphical representation of my personality profile test. </p>
					<p>It is comforting to read that it is in my nature to seek purpose. I do like my work to provide more than a pay check and have at times wondered where this desire comes from. The majority of the report resonates strongly with me despite the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) drawing criticism from within psychology circles. </p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>According to MBTI I am creative, insightful, principled, passionate and altruistic. All the strengths required to succeed in my ideal role in IT.</p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>The MBTI also shows I am sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoid the ordinary and prone to burnout. All of these weaknesses I am already aware of and have sought to correct through various self-help programs I have participated in. Being aware of where one needs to improve is important in becoming a better person in life as well as in the workplace.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>I enjoy working in teams, especially when it involves helping others and helping them succeed. I need to conscious that I tend to get frustrated if I don’t have a voice, or if there no meaning in my work. I also need to be sensitive to process and red-tape, particularly when I don’t feel it adds value.</p>
					<p>I understand that conflict may at times arise when working in a team, however one of my strengths if understanding we are all equals. This helps me understand other peoples motivations and helping them feel like they belong. </p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>I then discovered my learning style through EducationPlanner. Their testing showed I have a visual style of learning. I can picture what I am learning in my head and learn best using methods that are primarily visible</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Big 5 Factors</p>
					<p>Finally, I completed a Big Five personality trait test which, according to website 123test.com, shows “a concise measure of the five major factors of personality, as well as the six facets that define each factor”.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<p>This report I find the least accurate as, for example, the results indicate an extraverted personality, yet I have always considered myself more introverted. I can often display most characteristics of extraversion but require quiet and solitude to replenish my emotional energy. </p>
					<p>Of the three reports, I resonated most with the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. The learning style report from EducationPlanner was the most useful as it listed suggestions to optimise my visual style. </p>
					<p>Provided personality type tests are accurate and reliable, I can see great benefits in their use for forming a team. Depending on the nature of the team, the correct personalities can make success easier. For example, a diverse group of people with unique thinking styles is more likely to produce diverse ideas. This is desirable for a team where creativity is a key component. On the other hand, knowing the traits of people within a team can potentially help to avoid an imbalance in team composition. An example may be having a team full of Commanders (Using Myers-Briggs terminology) and Performers may simply create conflict with no productivity.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My idea for a project is something I am tentatively calling the Present Planner (or The Forgetful Husband), for people like me that struggle with important occasions and making sure these occasions are memorable for my loved ones.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>Important dates like anniversaries, birthdays and Christmas should be a time of joy and celebration, but for me they a source of stress. Knowing these occasions need to be appropriately celebrated gives me a strong desire to get it right, but this is usually followed by anxiety and fear of failure. I’m sure I am one of many people out there who have disappointed their partner by failing to remember, or properly plan for, an anniversary! </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The service (or app) would have two sections, People and Events. </p>
					<p>The people section will allow for input of people whose occasions you need to remember. The initial iteration would allow for basic data input on each person. This may include tracking history of previous gifts, like and dislikes, favourite places, sporting teams, etc. With the help of psychology and personality profiling professionals, future deployments may include personality trait questions that would suggest gifts ideas. Partnerships could then be formed with retail and experience providers as a means of monetising the service.</p>
					<p>The Events section would, at first, be a simple calendar to enter dates of important events to remember and allow you to link people to dates. Christmas for example would be linked to multiple people. With the additional of personality profiling and partner providers, the service would eventually send alerts for experiences (such as concerts or sporting events) that someone in your tracking list would enjoy, or sales at their favourite retail brand outlets. </p>
					<p>A premium paid service could potentially be added where the procurement, shipping and even card writing could be automated. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>This will require bringing together multiple technologies and expertise, such as CRM (customer relationship management) functionality, calendaring, webpage design, database integration and the building of intelligence and algorithms. B2B linkage, use of API’s and e-commerce would eventually be needed. All of this will need to be hosted on a cloud providers infrastructure such as AWS.</p>
					<p>With the ultimate goal of providing an end-to-end procurement service, a very complicated service architecture will result.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Entrepreneurship will the be the primary requirement as this is essentially describing a start-up company.  A team of developers with the relevant coding skills would start building this on cloud infrastructure with the aim of publishing API plug-ins for third-party providers. Project management and program management will keep it on track. Business Development people will work to bring partner providers on board.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>I have a friend who always remembers the special occasions and sends a card or gift without fail. I am always left think what a special and thoughtful friend that person is. I also acknowledge that it takes a certain personality with exceptional organisation skills to do that consistently. </p>
					<p>This service, when is becomes a seamless experience, will put that superpower into the hands of us mere mortals! </p>
