					<h1>Team Profile</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Everywhere Australia consists of four distinct personalities:</p>

					<ol>
						<li> <a href="https://meghancatterick.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Meghan Catterick</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://hackerman24816.github.io/Intro-to-IT-A1/ " target="_blank">Vincent Chieu</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://1jasoner1.github.io/" target="_blank">Jason Samaan</a></li>
						<li> <a href="https://niedzko.github.io/IITA1/" target="_blank">Konrad Niedzwiedz</a></li>
					<p></p>
					</ol>
					<p>We all come from diverse backgrounds and experience levels, bringing a unique blend of attributes to our collective team.
					<p>Meghan recently relocation to Australia from the UK and is looking to immerse herself into the IT industry. Having a strong background in IT recruitment, she has a unique perspective into the skills and experience required to succeed in this industry. She brings a project management background and tenacity to get the job done - as demonstrated by her undefeated boxing career!</p>
					<p>Vincent is from a Chinese and Vietnamese family and brings the creative flair to our group. His love of music and abilities as a piano player demonstrate his abilities to work independently and to progressively build his skills. He brings a natural curiosity and passion to all he does.</p>
					<p>Jason is the big-picture thinker of the team and is called to a greater purpose, as is demonstrated by his volunteer work. While he is a visionary and can see the big picture, he also likes to bring his team mates on the journey and enjoyed watching them reach their full potential. A great team-player.</p>
					<p>Konrad brings a wealth of experience in IT sales and business development. He looks for purpose in his work and likes to go about his business with integrity. Although introverted, he enjoys deep connections and can provide insightful advice when called upon. He is also a budding musician and enjoys creative endeavours. </p>
					<p>Assuming the accuracy of the Myers Briggs personality profiles, we are indeed a well-rounded team with personal attributes that complement each other. With two Diplomats, a Sentinel and an Explorer, we cover three of the four high-level MBTI roles with the Analyst the only omission. However, with Meghan as our resident Logistician, we have someone who thrives in facts and structure. Among us we bring a healthy balance of structure, creativity, harmony and strategic thinking to ensure team success.</p>

					<h1>Ideal Jobs</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Everywhere Australia is interested in thriving in the world of the Information Technology industry. Compared to other types of jobs that are similar to our ideal jobs, which are similar to the types of jobs we are looking for, the ideal jobs we are looking for have many similarities and differences. I will go over all these differences and similarities in this post.</p>
					<h2>Meghan</h2>

					<p>The choice Meghan made when it came to her career choice was Project Management. Meghan already has six or more years of experience and the skills required to become a successful Project Manager. The ability to manage digital projects end-to-end, engage stakeholders effectively and follow a structured approach under strict deadlines is also something Meghan excels at, as well as managing end-to-end Digital projects. Besides bringing a strong business acumen to the mining field once she has completed her IT bachelor's degree, Meghan would also like to pursue a position as a Junior Project Manager or Business Analyst that focuses on the mining industry. This would allow her to acquire an even deeper understanding of the industry and develop her business acumen further. This table results in a comparison of how her ideal job compares to other jobs in terms of similarities and differences between them:</p>
					<table id="jobComparison">
						<tr>
							<th>Similarities</th>
							<th>Differences</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>In some cases, senior system administrators can perform the role of project manager and be responsible for managing other system administrators, delegating work to them, etc. At the same time, a project manager would not typically manage non-senior system administrators.</td>
							<td>The system admin is responsible for managing the business's system architecture/ongoing operations, which are likely to have an impact on several of the projects that the project manager is working on. System administrators are typically on call, meaning that they may need to be available after hours, outside of normal work hours, and on weekends
							</td>
					</table>

					<p></p>
					<h2>Vincent</h2>

					<p>While he was in school doing his elective, Vincent developed a keen interest in IT that led him to pursue a career in IT. Despite the fact that Vincent does not have any experience or skills that would make him an ideal candidate for his ideal job, that does not stop him from learning and achieving what he requires in order to reach his goals. The ideal job that he dreams of doing after he has completed his ITIL foundation course is to work in the area of Technician, O.C.M.S End User Computing. With reference to the following table, it is possible to have an understanding of how his ideal job compares to other jobs in terms of their similarities and differences as far as similarities and differences are concerned:</p>
										<table id="jobComparison">
											<tr>
												<th>Similarities</th>
												<th>Differences</th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>The two need to be connected to a server in order to perform their functions.</td>
												<td>It seems like this will require more on-premises work, whereas system administrators don't really need to be on site much of the time (except for things like hardware installation and maintenance occasionally)</td>
										</table>
					<p></p>
					<h2>Jason</h2>

										<p>Although I have always been interested in IT, it was my choice to take an elective studying IST in high school which motivated me to learn more about it and continue to study it after graduation. Then, I spent a lot of time reading articles on reddit about cybersecurity and how it all works, which led me to gain a greater interest in networking and how it all works. It is essential that I have completed the bachelor course Cyber Security in order to gain experience with software, such as Python and Wireshark. The following table shows that I can gain a better understanding of how my ideal job compares to other jobs, based on their similarities and differences, in terms of their similarities and differences as far as their similarities and differences are concerned, based upon the following table: </p>
															<table id="jobComparison">
																<tr>
																	<th>Similarities</th>
																	<th>Differences</th>
																</tr>
																<tr>
																	<td>In addition to the on-site servers, there would be interactions between the software and the network, as well as the integrity and reliability of the network

										</td>
																	<td>As a general rule, a network administrator is responsible for maintaining and securing a computer network once it has been designed and </td>
															</table>


					<p></p>
					<h2>Konrad</h2>

				<p>The IT industry and the idea that new things will come into the IT world are something that Konrad appreciates and looks forward to. Konrad, in light of the above, has set his sights on working as a Technology Strategist in the future. In terms of experience, Konrad does have some, because he is working in a business development role, which involves selling workplace technology. It is with this in mind that I want to emphasize the fact that he has the ability to build relationships, establish trust, and listen to customers' requirements in order to translate them into sound strategic initiatives. He would like to move up to Microsoft in the near future after completing his bachelor's degree in computer science. This ideal job will give him a chance to acquire knowledge and experience about emerging fields such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence/machine learning, as well as blockchain technology. According to this table, it is possible to get a sense of how his ideal job compares to other jobs as far as their similarities and differences are concerned:</p>
				<table id="jobComparison">
					<tr>
						<th>Similarities</th>
						<th>Differences</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>There are some system admins who are given the authority/responsibility to make changes that have the potential to affect the business strategy in a negative direction.</td>
						<td>This sounds more like a planning job than an executing one, they are not involved in any day-to-day DeVos tasks. System administrators are typically on call, meaning that they may need to be available after hours, outside of normal work hours, and on weekends.</td>
