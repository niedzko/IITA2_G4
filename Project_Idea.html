					<h1>LendIt!</h1>
					<h2 align="justify">What is Lendit?</h2>
					<p align="justify">LendIt is an iOS-based app which allows users in nearby locations to share, review and lend items to neighbours / fellow users of the app. The purpose of LendIt is to enable users to easily access products they may not want or need to purchase for one-time uses while allowing the owner to earn some extra cash for items they may not like or use as much. This project will establish a basic version of the application, allowing users to begin to connect and enjoy the concept of LendIt!</p>

					<h2 align="justify">How will Lendit help others?</h2>
					<p align="justify">Following the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, a study which surveyed more than 7,000 Australians from May to June 2022 showed that 49% of respondents had experienced some reduction in income and 30% a significant salary reduction. With this in mind, people are less likely to purchase one-off unnecessary goods for single events. The LendIt app will connect neighbours in the community and allow them to lend items at a much lower cost than buying a new item <a href="https://aifs.gov.au/media/spending-less-worrying-more-how-covid-19-impacting-financial-wellbeing" target="_blank">‘(AIFS,2020)’</a></p>
					<p align="justify">With social media's rise and continued dominance, communities interact online for multiple purposes such as advice, suggestions, social, purchasing, and borrowing items. For example, Facebook Marketplace has 1 billion active users per month, all of which engage in purchasing or hire transactions of goods and services. Coupled with countless "Buy, Sell, Swap" groups on the platform, it proves there is a rise in activity for users engaging on the platform for more than just social interaction. LendIt, would operate a community similar to the likes of Facebook Market place, however, solely for lending items - not purchasing<a href="https://leadsbridge.com/blog/facebook-marketplace/.html" target="_blank">‘(Leadsbridge, 2022).’</a></p>

				 <div class="sectionTitle">
					<h1 align="justify">Phase One</h1>
					<p align="justify">Initially, the LendIt app will be built for iOS as we plan to release LendIt phase one into the local Australian market, where iOS holds 57.15% of the market share.(Statcounter, 2021-2022)</p>
					<p align="justify">The first release of the LendIt app will include the following features:</p>
					    <ul>
								<li>Geolocation services - we will incorporate Apple MapKit to allow users to share the location of products. This will work by showing the location of products on a map; users browsing products can then view where they are in the nearby neighbourhood. I did consider using Google Maps API as this is accessible on all devices; however, as phase one is to build the app on iOS, I thought the benefit of Apple MapKit being more user-friendly outweighs this consideration; <a href="https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/how-to-create-a-location-based-app-ideas-technologies-and-examples/" target="_blank">‘(Mobindustry, 2022)’</a> <a href="https://www.mobindustry.net/blog/google-maps-vs-apple-maps-best-choice-for-your-mobile-solution/" target="_blank">‘(Mobindustry, 2017)’</a></li>

								<li>Messaging function - there will be a messaging function on the app, allowing users to reach out to the item's owner and request LendIt. From there, the two users would organise the exchange via message;</li>

								<li>Database - the app will allow users to sign-up and create accounts to use LendIt. This information, coupled with the data stored when a user posts a product available to lend, requires the data to be stored in a database. The database I will implement is SQLite. I have chosen this database as it requires no installation/configuration, so hopefully, this should not add too much time to the development timeline. SQLite is versatile, and multiple platforms and languages use it, future-proofing developments/phase releases;<a href="https://www.trio.dev/blog/best-ios-database" target="_blank">‘(Trioblog)’</a></li>

								<li>With Lendit being a brand-new app to the market, we would imagine that initially there will not be a large user base and would therefore look to use cloud computing to host and store the applications data. Using cloud computing this will allow us to scale up as a business without any large upfront costs. We would look towards PaaS solutions such as Google App Engine, Red Hat OpenShift or Heroku to start off with giving us the autonomy to control our app code on a stable network platform. Then if required as we get more users to the app and grow we would look to move to more IaaS solutions such as AWS or Google Cloud. We would look to make this change when we can comfortably manage and require more control over our own infrastructure. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/iaas-paas-saas" target="_blank">‘(Hubspot, 2022)’</a></li>
							</ul>
							<p align="justify">As detailed above, phase one will include basic features to keep the app running and functional. I have planned it this way as I am conscious that if we complete this by assignment 3, it needs to be challenging yet feasible. However, I believe the features described will allow for effective use of the app and will still achieve the outcome of connecting local neighbours with items they may require to lend.</p>

							 <h1 align="justify">Phase Two</h1>
							 <p align="justify">In the second dream development phase, we will integrate a payment gateway to allow security deposits through the app. So, for example, you can lend this item, but a security deposit of $X amount will be held on your card in case of non-return, damages or cleaning fee. This will allow for peace of mind for users listing products and hopefully lead to increased activity on the app. Initially, as the purchase option, I would implement ApplePay and Apple in-app purchasing through the user's Apple account, with the view to expand this in the future on other non-iOS platforms.<a href="https://www.techugo.com/blog/integrate-payment-gateway-ios-app/" target="_blank">‘(Techugo, 2019)’</a> Once the payment gateway has been integrated, we would begin to charge users a small % fee of each successful transaction for listing their items on the platform.</p>
							 <p align="justify">During this phase it will also be beneficial to begin to introduce Artificial Intelligence to the Lendit app. As in phase two we will integrate a payment gateway, this will then commercialise the app bringing currency through the platform meaning there will hopefully be profits to reinvest. AI will be a great technology to help improve user experience – ultimately leading to more customers on Lendit, more interactions, more conversions and more profits to drive to achieve phase three! Artificial Intelligence will work by tracking a customer’s recent product views and transactions on the platform to suggest other products they may be interested in. This would suggest like for like products e.g.  “You recently viewed this handheld screwdriver, you may also like his hand-held screwdriver” or similar products e.g. “you recently viewed this handheld screwdriver, why not try this power screwdriver to get the job done easier.”</p>

							 <h1 align="justify">Phase Three</h1>
							 <p align="justify">In the third release, we will incorporate a delivery service similar to UberEATS. A user can lend another user's item, and the delivery service collects, drops and returns the object door to door, making this an easy-to-use service. For example, you could be in the middle of a DIY project and find you need a hammer; you open your LendIt app and see your neighbour has one. You can either collect the item yourself or use the delivery service to get this to you in the hour.</p>
							 <p align="justify">Delivery service apps such as Uber Eats have significantly changed how we order items. For example, on a Saturday night in 2004, XFactor is on, and Mum says it is takeaway for tea! She calls the local pizza shop, puts in the order, and then we all sit patiently waiting for our food to arrive. We were twitching the blinds, looking out the window at every car that drives down the street, and counting out the cash to ensure the right amount to give to the driver. However, now - thanks to the continuous evolution of technology, gone are the days of awkward eye contact with your neighbour, through the window, who you thought must be your 12" chicken feast pizza!</p>
							 <p align="justify">Specifically, UberEATS is the most popular food delivery service, with 81 million users internationally! That is 81 million people who have adapted and got on board with the revolutionised way to order. We can now pay with our cards or phones, track our drivers' every move and even tell them to leave it at the door meaning no awkward contact - what more could you want? <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-eats-statistics/" target="_blank">‘(Businessofapps, 2022)’</a></p>
							 <p align="justify">If we could implement a similar technology into hiring goods and services, this would have a chance of taking off as people love the convenience and not spending large sums of money on one-time use times.</p>

							 <h1 align="justify">Phase Four</h1>
							 <p align="justify">As the application continues to develop, user numbers increase, profits skyrocket... We will then have the means to continue improving our customer experience, ultimately driving the Lendit platform to be a leader within the industry of accessible goods and services. We will introduce the concept of using robot technology to improve the service our customers receive.</p>
							 <p align="justify">An addition to the LendIt app a delivery drone would be a very big upgrade. This drone will be able to deliver the requested item to the destination they choose, which is collected from a warehouse or from a person’s house. The way this system will work is:</p>
							 <ol>

								 <li>Customer rents item/items from app</li>
								 <li>Drone takes the location of the item and goes to it </li>
								 <li>The person will put the item in a compartment that is installed into the drone </li>
								 <li>When the compartment is closed the drone will begin its journey towards the customer</li>
								 <li>After item is received drone leaves</li>
								 <li>When the customer is finished, the drone will come pick it up and return the item to the owner and return back to LendIt</li>

							 </ol>

							 <h2 align="justify">Why will it be beneficial to LendIt?</h2>
							 <p align="justify">Adding drones to the workplace will bring many pros which will benefit LendIt very much. Using drones will allow human workers to not become essential to the workplace which will in turn allow for a multitude of different possibilities such as:</p>
							 <ul>

								 <li>No human error e.g., delivering to the wrong place</li>
								 <li>Faster collection and delivery as drones will be able to fly and go in a straight line directly towards the lender/customer</li>
								 <li>Drones will be cheaper than humans in the long term</li>
								 <li>Drones will not get tired and will be able to work at any time</li>

							 </ul>
								 <p align="justify">Overall, by adding drones to LendIt, the efficiency of collections and deliveries will be massive compared to hiring human workers. Drones won’t need to be paid and will reduce the amount of money needed to be spent. Although there are some cons to adding drones like humans will outperform drones in unexpected situations, the pros will heavily outweigh the cons.</p>

								 <h2 align="justify">Cyber Security</h2>
								 <p align="justify">Lendit’s security is extremely important because of the way applications are available to users over various networks and because of the fact that it is also connected to the cloud and as a result of that, applications are accessible from multiple networks at the same time. There are several things that are essential for the application to be safe from malicious attacks so that we can avoid any malice attacks on the application or the person using it:</p>
								 <ul>

									 <li><b>Authentication:<b>As part of the software development process for Lendit, a policy will be built into the application so that only one individual user has access to their account. The easiest way to achieve this is to ask the user to enter a username and password in order to log into Lendit for the first time. There will also be security questions provided to safely secure the account in case anything happens to the account. We will also include multi-factor authentication that you will be able to use in addition to all of this, which will enhance the security of your account if it is ever compromised in some way.</li>
									 <li><b>Authorisation:</b>As soon as the user is authenticated and authorised to use and access the application, the user may be able to access the application. When the user’s identity is compared with the list of authorised users, the system can validate whether the user has permission to access the application. Authentication must take place before authorisation in order for the application to match the user credentials only to those that have been validated before authorisation takes place.</li>
									 <li><b>Encryption:</b>It may be possible to protect sensitive data from being seen or even exploited by a cybercriminal menace once a user has been authenticated and has begun using the application. This can be accomplished through other security measures. In cloud-based application, where traffic containing sensitive data travels between the end user and the cloud, that traffic can be encrypted to keep the data safe.</li>
									 <li><b>Logging:</b>The logging can prove to be helpful in the event of a security breach in an application, as it can be determined who got access to the Lendit data and how it was obtained. This type of security provides the time-stamped record of when and by whom an aspect of the application was accessed as well as which aspects were accessed.</li>
									 <li><b>Security Testing:</b>There must be a process in place to ensure that all these security controls are working properly. It is possible to conduct a penetration test using social engineering techniques because it will be easy to try and fool users into granting unauthorised access to infiltrate their system.</li>

								 </ul>
								 <p align="justify">We believe that it is essential for us to ensure Lendit is a safe application for friendly users to browse through on a regular basis, lending things without any hesitation of any frauds once we provide the list of securities. In the future, we will have constant updates on how our security is being maintained, knowing that there will be other ways for hackers to infiltrate our data, and we will always be on top of it to ensure that no one’s identity will be stolen.</p>

								 <h2 align="justify">Block Chain</h2>
								 <p align="justify">The use of Blockchain technology in the evolution of Lendit will help in increased supply chain transparency and reduce the risk and cost across the process. Blockchain provides a distributed ledger which will increase the traceability of goods borrowed and could potentially allow for a borrowed item to be transferred between multiple borrowing customers without needing to be returned to its original owner. The blockchain technology will ensure that all goods, and any potential damage, can be traced back to the person responsible.</p>
								 <p align="justify">For a potential borrower, the strengthened security will provide an extra level of confidence that each item is free from fraud. This would be of specific benefit for high-value items.</p>
								 <p align="justify">For the owner of goods, blockchain will mean less time validating a customer and will simplify whatever means of exchanging contract terms via the smart contract use-case the technology provides.</p>
								 <p align="justify">Blockchains main benefit could be in way it enables peer-to-peer transactions, simplifying the payment process. This could also provide Lendit’s biggest challenge as financial payments could be passed directly from owner to borrower making it difficult for a central authority to claim a percentage of fees. An opportunity could arise to make this an open platform that removes the need for a central authority, as is the case with a platform like Uber.</p>
								 <p align="justify">As blockchain technology could be a foundational component of the Lendit offering, it’s introduction into the product stack should be considered in phase one of the product development. However as it is still an emerging technology, deployment could be delayed until the platform is more mature.</p>

								 <h2>How will we achieve this?</h2>
								 <p>Although I passionately believe that LendIt could be the next big thing, when fully developed, I understand I must learn to crawl before I can walk and walk before I can run. At this stage, in the application development world, I am learning to crawl.</p>
								 <p>I have detailed the initial stage one features the app will include above. But, to reiterate, this will consist of: geolocation services, messaging functions and a database.</p>
								 <p>Before I can look to implement any features to LendIt, I need to establish the base of it. This iOS app will be developed using Swift; however, I am currently a novice in Swift and lean on the MIT App Inventor tool.<a href="https://www.apple.com/au/swift/.html" target="_blank">‘(Apple)’</a> <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started.html" target="_blank">‘(appinventor)’</a></p>
								 <p>Once I have my basic app up and running, I will integrate features such as the Apple MapKit, messaging functions and SQLite. I will achieve this by following the MIT App Inventor's guidance and various online sources that offer support information about developing apps.</p>
								 <p>I hope this should be feasible as I have kept the initial version of the applications <i>fairly</i>basic.

									 <h2>The End Results<h2>
										 <p>By assignment three, we hope to have successfully created phase one of my project idea - LendIt. I believe once the first version of LendIt is designed and available to the market, the initial impact will be that it creates a different community, specifically focused on neighbours in the local area.</p>
										 <p>Similar concepts, e.g. Facebook Marketplace is useful for a local marketplace now; however, Facebook was and still is very much a social platform used to stay connected with family and friends.</p>
										 <p>LendIt will create a community dedicated to those who want to lend items from nearby neighbours. I hope this will initially have a positive social impact, and although the primary purpose may be to lend goods and services, it may also connect people.</p>
										 <p>Additionally, the geolocation feature will provide the accessibility and convenience of products to those affected by loss in income due to the pandemic by connecting people with cheaper products instead an expensive outright purchase.</p>
