					<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p align="justify">Our group name, Everywhere Australia, is derived from one of our biggest challenges – figuring out what time our meetings were in each of our local time zones! Being a team with individuals from literally ‘everywhere in Australia’, we were just about able to commit to meeting up over MS Teams twice a week to discuss the assignment, distribute work and understand how we were each progressing with our assigned tasks.</p>
					<p align="justify">Although a challenge, as a team this is one aspect that we felt worked well towards working together to get the assignment completed. Within our weekly catchups we rotated the chair of the meeting between Konrad & Meghan, our structured agenda included: check-in on progress; what help is needed and what do we want done by the next meeting, with any additional issues being raised by team members in the catch-up. We feel as a group we were able to use these meetings effectively and equally distribute the work between ourselves.</p>
					<p align="justify">Throughout the assignment we also believe that a strength of ours has been clear communication. For example, in our first meeting when we initially met as a team, both Vincent and Jason were open to say they would prefer not to chair the group but were happy to contribute to the weekly meetings and get on with the work. This clear communication within the group has let us progress with defined roles / personalities within the group.</p>
					<p align="justify">With this in mind, one thing that has surprised us as a group is how easily we have got on and been able to work together without clashes. On reflection, the clear communication in the group has aided this as people have been open and honest and delivered work agreed to and if someone has a questions, is struggling or does not have the capacity to complete assigned work this has been communicated so other team members can assist in a timely manner. Opposed to say, a team member dropping off the face of the earth and the remaining members are not sure if they are continuing with their work or not.</p>
					<p align="justify">AOne aspect we would look to improve for our next assignment is we would aim to have work completed at an earlier date, so we have more time to evaluate and fine tune our work before submitting the assignment. This is an aspect we will learn from and improve on our next assignment.</p>

					<h1>Individuals Comments</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p align="justify">Konrad – I was most surprised by the difficulty it was for us to all meet at common times, based on time zones and availability. In the past six years I have never had to travel for work as much as I have in this past month, which is frustrating that it has caused this difficulty arranging times with group work. We have been flexible as a team and although we are all very different individuals with different home lives and schedules, we have overcome this situation and been consistently able to catch up at agreed times.</p>
					<p align="justify">Jason – Most surprising to me was how well we have been able to get on and work together as a team, I was not sure what to expect when placed into a team with individuals I had not met or spoke with face to face. However, we all worked well and got along so easily with no clashes of personality in the group and everyone playing to their strengths to help the team complete the assignment.</p>
					<p align="justify">Vincent – I have been surprised with how quickly the end of this assignment has come around, as we discussed as a group our area for improvement would be to have completed the work sooner to have more time to reflect and review on our content and submission. I believe we maybe started the project a bit late but this is something we will work on for the next assignment. A benefit of working in the team has been that we have been able to distribute the work well to get the assignment completed on time working to each of our strengths.</p>
					<p align="justify">Meghan - Similarly to my team, I am also surprised about how quickly the time has passed on this assignment and feel come the next assignment we will have to try get ahead sooner to have more time to fine tune our submission. I think we have worked well as a team, and everyone has got along well in our weekly catchups. I value that we have all been open in our communication and am surprised that I have been lucky to be in a team where not one member has become a ghost mid-way through and we have worked together to get this assignment completed.</p>
