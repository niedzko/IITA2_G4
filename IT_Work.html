					<h2>Interview with Jon Beets – Software & Database Developer and Solutions Designer.</h2>
					<h3> Conducted by Meghan Catterick</h3>
					<h3>Interview prepared by Everywhere Australia</h3>
					<h3> Date of Interview - 7th October 2022 </h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify">Jon Beets is what you would describe as a seasoned professional within the IT Development world. Connecting through Microsoft Teams, the post COVID norm, I had the pleasure to speak with Jon to gain insight on his experience working as an IT Professional.</p>
					<p align="justify">Jon joined the meeting with a super-imposed background honouring the Japanese F1, as our meeting date was shared by the first return of this event since 2019 due to COVID enforced cancellations.</p>
					<p align="justify"><em>‘I generally create a background on Teams when on customer meetings, for example - pictures of flowers or places I have been, to generate a conversation starter.’</em> – Jon Beets </p>

				<article>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b> Please could you give us an overview of your job and what exactly it is you do in that position? </h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> I have my own business and I consult / contract to customers. Currently, I have customers in both NSW and QLD, in a very specialised area of legislation drafting. I provide both coding / software development services as well as system support specifically for the NSW customer. They are using a product called <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/framemaker/using/using-framemaker/user-guide/frm_getstarted_gs-what-is-framemaker.html" target="_blank">‘FrameMaker’</a> which is very specialised and a bit of a beast, which I have a lot of experience with. So, in a nutshell, that is what I am doing at the moment.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b> What programming languages / technologies are you specialising in at the moment?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> <a href"https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp" target"_blank">C++</a>, a version of JavaScript called <a href="https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/extendscript-overview.html" target="_blank">ExtendScript</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php" target="_blank">C#</a>. Then on the infrastructure side of things there is <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/powershell/powershell_scripting.htm" target="_blank">PowerShell Scripts</a>, but that is really it as there is no database. Oh of course, there is excel, excel is a wonderful little tool for so many things </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b> What type of people do you work / interact with? </h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> Well, I do not have any employees so generally it is just me interacting with the customer, I work with the <b>CEO</b> usually, then day to day I interact with the <b>Project Team</b> – so the <b>Project Manager</b> within that team, any other members typically there would be <b>Testers, Subject Matter Experts</b> who understand the environment and what is required. With support it’s the interacting with <b>anyone in IT</b> and assisting, if they cannot fix something they will come and talk to me.</p>
					<p align="justify">In my role, I have been working for myself for some time now, it is important to build relationships and talk to people – ask the right questions and most importantly listen to people.</p>
					<p align="justify"><b>Jon added later in the interview [15:00]</b> – speaking of interacting with types of people in the workplace an important one is <b>peer</b> interaction, for example this could be online or at a conference speaking with people doing the same thing as you. These days there are lots of online communities where you can ask peers questions and generate conversation which does not need to be face to face. But every conference I have ever been to I get far more out of networking with the other people than I do the presentations. Getting ideas, talking to others, seeing what problems they have… </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b> Do you work with business to deliver end-to-end solutions, or specialise in one part of the wider solution? </h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> End-to-end, I am involved with the scoping of requirements, agreeing on what is to be done, providing a quote - <em>which when you have your own business this is very important to keep an eye on / take care of as more often than not things you did not expect can come up. Any project, especially around computing software, you need to have some allowance and am I any good at that? Well, 50:50 but you try to allow for it.</em></p>
					<p align="justify">But back to end-to-end, actually delivering and being involved in testing I find really useful, using test developments and test scripts, that being said – <em>I am the world’s worst tester as I always do things the same way, that being most of the time goes with edgecases, as a user will say ‘well we do it this way’, then you think, well if that is that way, then this is this way and so on so on. So understanding for one path there is multiple outcomes, you try to plan for this from the start, but dealing with them if they come up throughout testing.</em></p>
					<p align="justify">So there’s test scripts and being involved with the final sign off, it is end-to-end, it is very creative and satisfying to see it working! </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b>How long do these projects usually take?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> So, the current project I am working on I started in January last year (2021) and expected it should be completed by June last year (2021), but for one reason or another it is still going. That is not atypical for software project and within a commercial organisation that might be different as they have tighter controls, but they might put on additional resources to achieve. So, it is really variable and is a mixture of short projects which start ‘here’ and end ‘here’, which are really simple and job done, but mostly it takes longer.</p>
					<p align="justify"></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b>Do you find that mid-project requirements can change?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> Absolutely, you have to have a mechanism built in to cater for this such as a ‘change request’ mechanism. Most customers I have dealt with are really good about ‘well actually yes, we changed our mind or now need to do this’ and that is a change request which is quoted separately.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b>You are based at the Sunshine Coast, do you work remotely or go to client sites often?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b>I have always worked remotely, even before the pandemic, however, I find you still need to go to site now and then to run training. Training can be delivered online, however, training in the classroom is much more interactive as it allows for the opportunity to ask questions, someone asking a question then prompts someone else to ask a question, making me as the presenter think ‘oh, maybe I did not explain that so clearly’, giving you a chance to go over it again, whereas delivering online allows for limited feedback usually. You have a Q&A session at the end, but not as interactive.</p>
					<p align="justify">So I work mostly remotely online, as when you are writing code, one of the big things is not to be interrupted, because quite often, getting interrupted means you forget as it is all in the head, you have written it down, wrote an algorithm, your class mates will understand this more in the future, so you know what you need to do, but in your head you go ‘do a,b & c’ in your head, but then you get interrupted and you have forgotten it all. Coding in quiet environments is important. I used to work in customer environments and more often than not they would put the contractors in the noisest place, so my solution was to put headphones on as that was white noise for me.</p>
					<p align="justify">It is a mixture of both (remote and onsite) at the moment, it looks like I will be going down in November for a few days. But before the pandemic I would work more on-site with the customer as especially as a contractor they like to see you onsite to deal with people. These days there is less of that with the conference capability, MS Teams, Zoom etc.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b>What is the most challenging aspect of your role?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> There is lots of challenges, a lot of what I do is very technical, getting back at looking at software projects having the client make sure they understand the requirements as usually they don’t and it quite hard to make them sit down and explain ‘yes we need to do x,y & z, but sometimes we need to do a,b & c to get there’.</p>
					<p align="justify">From the technical side of things, a challenge is working with products, you need to keep on top of technology and understand what is changing, that is a never-ending story as things change from year to year, month to month. It is also fun as you are constantly challenging your brain to learn new things.</p>
					<p align="justify">Those are the two main points, getting the client to understand requirements, and change requests which we have already touched on and then the constant changes with the tools and environments, software versions. Also, working for yourself you need to keep on top of training, yet this is self-funded, e.g. if I do a week’s training, that is a week with no income, but then the benefit is later on you will have knowledge of something. What I tend to do now, for example, a new version of FrameMaker has been released, I will have a look at it, test it in one customer’s environment, I will then show another customer a little while after, with the idea that the customer then might bring me in to help support with the updated version, so it is a good way to try generate work.</p>
					<p align="justify">Another big challenge when you work for yourself is getting paid! If you work as an employee as you get paid every month or two weeks, yet, when you work for yourself you work and then put in an invoice and they have follow up in a nice way to try and get paid. I often find establishing a relationship with the accounts payable is very beneficial. </p>
					<p></p>
					<h3 align="justify"><b>Q:</b>What experience has led you to where you are today?</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify"><b>A:</b> I started out as I liked fixing things and I liked being helpful, I started of working in computers when they were office equipment - adding machines / mechanical accounting machines. I enjoyed resolving problems. A software program, performing1 a task, is solving a problem and there is a lot of creativity about that – which is what I like.</p>
					<p align="justify">Some roles I have had have been really challenging. Does <a href"https://www.hpe.com/au/en/compute/hpc/cray.html" target="_blank">Cray Super Computer </a> mean anything to you? The origin of supercomputer was used for car, chemical modelling, they have come on a lot now. But they were complex and needed a high-tech problem-solving capability. I had a scientist come to me with an old print out and say ‘this calculation is out by x’, so I would have to run the code to exercise the issue and then go in with a oscilloscope, the oscilloscope was looking at electrical signals to work out where the problem was. So that was very challenging but a lot of fun. I am motivated by solving problems and helping people out, it is always challenging which is very motivating.</p>
