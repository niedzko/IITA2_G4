				<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>Within my IT specific skill set, ‘Project Management’ ranks sixth on the list in terms of demand from employers – I find this interesting (in a positive way) as I would not have thought a skill quite as general such as ‘Project Management’ would rank so high against specific technologies e.g. ‘SAP’.  My other IT specific skills business management, building relationships and business analysis also rank highly as eighth, ninth and tenth respectively – equally I find this industry data to be reassuring towards my ideal role of project manager. </p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>I understand there are higher ranked IT specific skills within the data set e.g. ‘SQL’ ranked first, ‘JavaScript’ – second and ‘JAVA’ fourth – however, as my ideal role of Project Manager is quite general at this point in time, this industry data definitely shows an insight into which areas may be best to specialise in. For example, to gain experience in any of the earlier listed technologies I could specialise as more of an applications Project Manager than say infrastructure. </p>
				<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>In terms of general skills, my ideal role of Project Manager covers an abundance of the greatest in demand from the data set. The top five from the data - communication skills, problem solving, organisational skills, writing, teamwork / collaboration are all skills required to be a Project Manager, having seen this within the industry data it definitely motivates me to continue developing my more general skills to grow over time. The data illustrates that softer skills are just as important as technical knowledge in stakeholder / client facing roles such as project management. </p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>At this stage, not within the required skill set for my ideal job lies ‘Troubleshooting’ ranked sixth and then ‘Creativity’ and ‘Research’ at ninth and tenth. Although these skills are not laid out in my required skill set, on reflection I believe these would be skills gained in a project management environment. For example, troubleshooting – this could entail working with the delivery team to understand why an application is not functioning and follow a troubleshooting process to overcome the issue. Creativity – to get projects over the line you may need to be creative with your methods of having groups of people work together. Research – before any project you will need to research and understand the best way to deliver – this may fall down to other specialists within the delivery team e.g. business analysts, but as a project manager I will need to be able to understand and conduct my own research at times.</p>
				<p></p>
				<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>Having reviewed the burning glass data, I was at first concerned when I evaluated the ‘Top IT Job Titles’ excel and realised that ‘Project Manager’ was not on the list. However, having reviewed the skills data files, I am confident that a role within IT Project Management is still the path I would like to pursue within my career. Project Management is ranked highly within the IT specific skills and requires a lot of general skills which are in demand from employers.</p>
				<p>A valuable insight I can take from this data is what IT Specific Skills are in demand with employers, this will allow me to understand what types of projects are out there and ultimately what area of project management to specialise in e.g. applications.</p>

					<p>My chosen ideal job was Technology Strategist within Microsoft. In generic terms this translates to consultancy, a function that is in high demand in any industry sector. Being a consultant means having enough knowledge and experience in a given industry that it becomes of value to an organisation or entity, who are therefore willing to pay for it. </p>
					<p>This job requires most of the generic skills listed by Burning Data, but the actual postings of an occupation in Technology Consultant category was at the lower end when compared to others. Most ICT job postings are in the software development and software engineering space, meaning any consultancy position would be rarely advertised, and highly contested whenever it is.  </p>
					<p>My opinion of my ideal job has been reinforced by looking at the Burning Glass data, particularly when one considers it is 4 years old. Technology Strategy advise in this rapidly changing world will only increase in demand, particularly when it is provided by someone with industry experience and deep domain knowledge.  </p>

					<p>The ideal job that I chose was the O.C.M.S End User computing, which is a job which requires expert knowledge of OCMS hardware (desktops, laptops, mobiles, and tablets). This job requires knowledge in Microsoft windows which is ranked fourth in demand for employers. It also requires Microsoft office which is ranked 18th. The general skills that the job will need are communication skills (ranked 1st), problem solving (ranked 2nd), organizational skills (ranked 3rd), troubleshooting (ranked 6th), and detailed-oriented (ranked 8th).</p>
					<p>The three highest IT related skills that are not in the required skillset for O.C.M.S computing are business management, business analysis, and graphic design. These three skills will not be required in the skillset of my ideal job, and I will not need to develop them in my path towards this job. In the general skillset the top three that will not be needed in my ideal job will be writing, research, and mentoring. Writing will not be needed as I will be creating new software for the company. Research will also not be needed as I am only creating and updating the software. Mentoring will have the same result as the previous two where I am only developing and maintaining software for O.C.M.S hardware.</p>
					<p>Looking back at the burning glass data, I have discovered that there are actually many requirements on my ideal job and is not on the burning glass data for the top IT job titles. After looking through it more carefully, although there are many different requirements in the ideal job I chose, I believe that I still want to continue with O.C.M.S End User Computing as my ideal job throughout my career.</p>

					<h2>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
						<p></p>
					<p>An ideal job for me would be to be in charge of Network and System Administration in the Cyber Security field. One of the options that I could alternate with was System Administrator, the position which is ranked 8th; however, the difference between Network Administrator and System Administrator is that Network Administrators look after the network, while System Administrators deal with the computers themselves.</p>

					<h2>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
						<p></p>
					<p>Despite the fact that the three skills that are ranked the highest in The Burning Glass data are Project Management as the fourth, Business Management at the sixth, and Business Analysis at the ninth, these are not skill sets that are needed for Network and System Administration. It seems as though I will not be able to gain those skills and experience with the way things are going to unfold and everything will work out as planned because they are not a requirement for my ideal job, but I wouldn't be opposed to gain those skills if it was a must have for me.</p>

					<h2>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h2>
						<p></p>
					<p>TI believe that if we were to compare it with the Burning Glass data, it would be easy to see that it does cover a great deal of the general skills required to work in Network and System Administration. Observations I have made from The Burning Glass data indicate that SQL ranked first, JavaScript ranked second, Microsoft Windows ranked fourth, and SAP ranked sixth based on my observations. There is no doubt that these skills are also essential in the field of Network and System Administration, and I am happy to hear that this is the case because it would enable me to learn a great deal more. </p>

				<article>
					<h2>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>Taking the understanding that three of the three highest individual skills that are not required for Network and System Administration are the following; Writing ranks fourth, Mentoring ranks 13th, and Presentation Skills ranks 14th, it is reasonable to assume that the following three skills are the highest. Having said that, I think it is self-explanatory as to why the writing itself is not required as I will be in a room filled with technology, and it is quite likely I will have an iPad or some other sort of accessory available to me to compose my notes of what is going on in the room. There will not be any mentoring needed with the job that I have selected, due to the fact that I will most likely be working alone. Therefore, it will not be necessary for me to mentor someone since I will be working alone. The same goes for Presentation Skills not being an essential trait for the job as there is not a lot of group work going on in my dream job because there is not a lot of interaction with others. </p>

					<h2>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>
						<p></p>
					<p>Although I was worried that Network and System Administration was not in the rankings, the skills provided in the data did not fail with skill requirements and I am satisfied with that. Even though I was concerned that Network and System Administration did not appear in the rankings, the skills provided in the data are in line with the skills required, and I am satisfied with that fact. I have more confidence now that I have Burning Glass data to back me up in my efforts to attain my ideal job as I strive forward.</p>
