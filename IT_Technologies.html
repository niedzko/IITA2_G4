					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p align="justify">Machine Learning (ML) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Science which uses data and algorithms to mimic human-like intelligence, ultimately with the goal to improve it’s accuracy of prediction / suggestions.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/cloud/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">(IBM, 2020)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">This is achieved by using algorithms to interpret data, which then generate insights from the information leveraged. The algorithms within ML create mathematical models using sample data, to make decisions without being specifically programmed to do so.<a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/what-is-artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">(Simplilearn, 2022)</a> & <a href="https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-machine-learning/" target="_blank">(Dataversity, 2021)</a></p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>The history of Machine Learning</h3>
					<p align="justify">The concept of Machine Learning was first introduced in 1943 by logician Walter Pitts and neuroscientist Warren McCulloch form the publishing of a mathematical paper mapping the decision-making process in human cognition and neural networks. The paper recognised every neuron in the brain as a simple digital processor and the brain as a whole computing machine.<a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/the-history-of-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank">(Analyticsindiamag, 2022)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">Following this, in 1950 Alan Turing, a mathematician and computer scientist, created the “Turning Test”. This test requires a computer to fool a human into thinking the machine is also a human being – this is still unmastered by any machine even in 2022.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/19/a-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read/?sh=4ba4f0ca15e7" target="_blank">(Forbes, 2016)</a><a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/the-history-of-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank">(Analyticsindiamag, 2022)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">Later in 1962, Arthur Samuel wrote the first computer program which played a game of checkers, this was built on an IBM 7094 computer and used Machine Learning to improve each time the game was played. This was a milestone in the field as the computer beat a human (self-proclaimed checkers master – Robert Nealey).<a href="https://www.ibm.com/au-en/cloud/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">(IBM, 2020)</a><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/19/a-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read/?sh=4ba4f0ca15e7" target="_blank">(Forbes, 2016)</a>
					<p align="justify">From here the technology continued to develop and improve year on year, some other significant achievements with Machine Learning include: .</p>
					<ul>
						<li align="justify">1990s — Machine learning shifts from a knowledge-driven approach to a data-driven approach.</li>
						<li align="justify">2006 — Geoffrey Hinton coins the term “deep learning” to explain new algorithms that let computers “see” and distinguish objects and text in images and videos.</li>
						<li align="justify">2010 — The Microsoft Kinect can track 20 human features at a rate of 30 times per second, allowing people to interact with the computer via movements and gestures.</li>
						<li align="justify">2011 — IBM’s Watson beats its human competitors at Jeopardy.</li>
						<li align="justify">2011 — Google Brain is developed, and its deep neural network can learn to discover and categorise objects much the way a cat does.</li>
						<li align="justify">2012 – Google’s X Lab develops a machine learning algorithm that is able to autonomously browse YouTube videos to identify the videos that contain cats.</li>
						<li align="justify">2014 – Facebook develops DeepFace, this is a software algorithm that is able to recognise humans from photos.</li>
						<li align="justify">2015 – Amazon launches its own machine learning platform.</li>
						<li align="justify">2015 – Microsoft creates the Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit, which enables the efficient distribution of machine learning problems across multiple computers.</li>
						<li align="justify">2015 – Over 3,000 AI and Robotics researchers, endorsed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, sign an open letter warning of the danger of autonomous weapons which select and engage targets without human intervention.</li>
						<li align="justify">2016 – Google’s artificial intelligence algorithm beats a professional player at the Chinese board game Go, which is considered the world’s most complex board game.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/19/a-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read/?sh=4ba4f0ca15e7" target="_blank">(Forbes, 2016)</a> & <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/the-history-of-machine-learning-algorithms/" target="_blank">(Analyticsindiamag, 2022)</a></p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>
					<p align="justify">There are four types of Machine Learning algorithms. One of them is 'Supervised Learning', this is when the algorithm’s output is fed into the system so that the machine understands the patterns before working on them. Essentially, giving the machine the answer, so the model then will process the algorithm many times until it is able to identify underlying patterns in the data.<a href="https://omdena.com/blog/machine-learning-examples/" target="_blank">(Omdena, 2022)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">A second algorithm type is 'Unsupervised Learning', this approach uses algorithm to cluster unlabeled data. This is useful if you wish to uncover relationships and insights in unlabeled datasets. Unlike supervised learning, models feed input data with unknown desirable outcomes. So, inferences are made based on circumstantial evidence without training or guidance.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/unsupervised-learning" target="_blank">(IBM, 2020)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">Then we have 'Semi-Supervised Learning', this is a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning, meaning it uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. This provides the benefits of both unsupervised and supervised learning while avoiding the challenges of finding a large amount of labeled data.<a href="https://www.datarobot.com/blog/semi-supervised-learning/#:~:text=Semi-supervised%20machine%20learning%20is,large%20amount%20of%20labeled%20data" target="_blank">(DataRobot, 2020)</a></p>
					<p align="justify"> Finally, 'Reinforcement Learning' is where various software & machines take the best action to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning as this algorithm is not fed the desired output within a training data set, but it is to learn from its experience.<a href="https://omdena.com/blog/machine-learning-examples/" target="_blank">(Omdena, 2022)</a></p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>What are the uses of ML today?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li align="justify">Healthcare & Medical diagnosis</li>
						<li align="justify">Face recognition</li>
						<li align="justify">Map travel time predictions</li>
						<li align="justify">Public safety – crime heat maps</li>
						<li align="justify">Agriculture – insights on crops for farmers so they can better utilise their manpower</li>
						<li align="justify">Smart assists e.g. alexa, siri </li>
						<li align="justify">Government industry & policymaking – data driven policies</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p align="justify">Machine Learning, as described, has already had a huge impact on our lives and how they function today. Whether we consider something so trivial such as the effects of ML on social media e.g. how we receive tailored adverts, facial recognition in photos and people we may know to connect with online etc.<a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/technologies-making-social-media-better/" target="_blank">(AppInventiv, 2022)</a> Or something with a bit more significance to improving lives such as ML impact on healthcare e.g., Pfizer uses “Machine Learning and natural language for processing for immuno-oncology research about how the body’s immune system can fight cancer.” <a href="https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning-healthcare" target="_blank">(Builtin, 2022)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">Although Machine Learning has significantly improved our way of life, it is also important to consider the negative impacts this advancing technology could have. If we refer to the earlier mentioned concern back in 2015 “Over 3,000 AI and Robotics researchers, endorsed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, sign an open letter warning of the danger of autonomous weapons which select and engage targets without human intervention.”.<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2016/02/19/a-short-history-of-machine-learning-every-manager-should-read/?sh=4ba4f0ca15e7" target="_blank">(Forbes, 2016)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">It is believed that the technology required to have functioning autonomous weapons is imminent and would be feasible to expect within years. The concern is if this technology is legal, the creation will be expedited and although some may say “AI can be used to make the battlefield a safer place for military personnel”, a strongly shared view is that this technology in the wrong hands will result in greater loss of life than benefit.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/27/musk-wozniak-hawking-ban-ai-autonomous-weapons" target="_blank">(The Guardian, 2015)</a></p>
					<p align="justify">It is important to reflect to understand that advancing technologies are often a great benefit and improvement to our lives, however, sometimes if controlled by groups of people who do not wish to use it for the greater good can be of grave concern to all people who may be at threat.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2>How will this effect me?</h2>
					<p align="justify">Personally, I see the positives with Machine Learning and its continuous development as I appreciate the advancement it brings to our day to day lives. Using data to drive outcomes is a sensible way to evaluate and improve most activities whether that by my personal day to day life e.g., a more tailored experience online, map travel time predictions, smart assists etc. Or even the positive impact data driven choices can have on the wider community e.g, improved understanding of healthcare, better distribution of services through public safety & agricultural analysis, improvement of safeguarding, government policies.</p>
					<p align="justify">Although data is excellent to improve menial tasks and it is good to improve the community generally, there must be a consideration and wider discussion around where the line is to be drawn as to when something stops being ‘data driven’ and is pushed onto a real life human, with empathy, to make the call / decision.<p>
					<p align="justify">Now I understand that we, humans, build algorithms to essentially allow our machines to ‘learn’. However, if we reflect on the autonomous weapons argument, even if this was created and put in the hands of people who say they will “make the battlefield a safer place for military personnel”.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/27/musk-wozniak-hawking-ban-ai-autonomous-weapons" target="_blank">(The Guardian, 2015)</a>  How can a computer, a machine, make the decision as to whether it can take a person’s life or not? My statement might become back dated in years to come, and this may be another Arthur Samuel in 1962 - creating the first program to beat a human at checkers – how could it do that? But ultimately, my view today is that even a person who can read emotion in a situation much better than a machine may take the wrong call to end someone’s life, so how can we put that responsibility into an algorithm?</p>

					<h1>Cyber Security - Jason</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p align="justify">A general knowledge of cybersecurity is that it protects software, hardware, and data from cyber threats. Many companies, including individual parties use cybersecurity to protect their information against unauthorized access to prevent them from gaining access to their data.</p>
					<p align="justify">Cyberattacks are always aimed to access, change, or manipulate sensitive information. Executing properly can be hard because there are more devices than there are people, and the attackers are becoming more ingenious. Cyberattack can infiltrate your personal privacy, using it to claim your identity and impersonating you to gain more information from close friends and families and will have a lot of power and start extorting money.</p>
					<p align="justify">A good cybersecurity plan can ensure the best security against any malicious attacks that can infiltrate the person's system, gaining access to any sensitive data. Cybersecurity is important because everyone benefits from it. Cybersecurity has made a major impact in the online industry because it helps secure data from any kind of threat, and it also protects your system from any viruses. The intention of having any type of cybersecurity is to make sure that there are minimal cyber-attacks and unauthorized access.</p>
					<p align="justify">Becoming more dependent on technology, we must ensure that we familiarize ourselves with any threat that could happen, for example; Phishing.</p>
					<p align="justify">Phishing is sending fraud emails that may be real and the aim of it is to steal your personal information. Phishing is becoming immensely popular due to data being leaked and exposing emails so not every email you receive is legit. The emails they send might look legit, but you need to be careful and keep an eye out of the senders' emails and you will be able to tell if the sender is legit or phishing.</p>
					<p align="justify">Always protect your password and never tell anyone. Make sure to always use different passwords for different accounts and update your password regularly, and never let your browser save any sensitive details because it can be accessed if you ever get key logged. Make sure to always keep your devices and app up to date. Ensure that you have an anti-virus application on your computer to keep you safe when browsing the internet. Anything can happen in the future, but cybersecurity will always remain relevant since companies heavily rely on it and most of the people today use technology.</p>
					<p align="justify">Cybersecurity will progress over the years to come even if the industry changes but will be able to accept the challenge. Keeping in mind that they will always develop more advanced malicious attacks and viruses to penetrate any sensitive data. In that case, the people in the industry will have to study the virus attacks and or the malicious so they can prevent that from happening. It is a cycle of cat and mouse, so even if the virus is good at infiltrating the security will be better once they studied what they used.</p>

					<p></p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p align="justify">Cyberattacks can cause a lot of issues. It can affect everyone, including business and people's trust. In general, there are three types of impact that can be attributed to a security breach: financial, reputational, and legal.</p>
					<p align="justify">There are many instances where cyberattacks result in significant financial losses because of; theft of company information, theft of financial information, theft of money, disruption to trading and loss of business or contract. Customer relationships are based on trust, which is one of the most essential elements. In many cases, cyberattacks can cause considerable damage to your business' reputation as well as undermine the trust that your customers have in you.</p>
					<p align="justify">In turn, this could result in a loss of customers, a loss of sales, a loss of profits, and the possibility of bankruptcy for the company. You may even find that reputational damage does affect your suppliers, as well as the relationships that your company may have with partners, investors, or other stakeholders that have a stake in your business.</p>
					<p align="justify">As a company, it is important that you manage all personal data that you hold in a secure manner, whether it is the data that you hold on to your employees or your customers. There may be fines and regulatory sanctions imposed on you if there is an accidental or deliberate compromise of this data, and you have failed to deploy the appropriate security measures. Businesses can be devastated by security breaches. It is extremely important to manage the risks in a way that is appropriate. In the event of an attack, a cyber security incident response plan can help mitigate the impact of the attack, report the incident to the relevant authority, clean up the affected systems and get your business back up and running in the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

					<p></p>
					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p align="justify">As a society, we are all constantly affected by the internet and technology in one way or another, as we live in a digital age. It is common for us to exchange information in our everyday lives through the use of electronic devices and the Internet. With the help of a network or the internet and electronic devices, some unscrupulous groups ply their trade by committing a variety of cyber-crimes using an electronic device or communication device. Making sure that my friends and family are educated on what could potentially happen to them. One of them would be sharing personal information. It is hard to imagine all the various places where their information can reside on the internet, and just how easy it would be for hackers to steal it for malicious reasons in the future.</p>
					<p align="justify">The other focus would be software updates. It is important that you keep them informed regarding the fact that security issues are constantly being discovered and fixed, and that they should not let their devices become outdated. If possible, ensure that their computers, smartphones, and other internet connected devices are kept up to date with the latest software. Ensuring that they do not install unnecessary software onto their devices. Informing them about Wi-Fi security, ensuring that the Wi-Fi networks in their homes are properly secured. Strong passwords and a 2FA authenticator are necessary as well, making sure that they are aware of the characteristics of a strong password, and how multi-factor authentication can be enabled if necessary.</p>

				<h1>Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies – Konrad</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify">What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What technological or other developments make this possible?</p>
					<p align="justify">The terms blockchain, cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are frequently lumped together, along with digital currency; sometimes they're erroneously used interchangeably.</p>
					<p align="justify">Although they're all under the umbrella of distributed ledger technology, each one is a distinct entity.</p>
					<ul>
						<li align="justify">Blockchain is the technology; more specifically, it's the technology that constructs a decentralized digital ledger that enables exchanges between multiple parties in a secure, immutable manner.</li>
						<li align="justify">Digital currency refers to any form of currency that is available only in digital or electronic form and shared without an intermediary. This includes digital money issued by governments and central banks as well as cryptocurrency. Digital currency is sometimes called digital money, electronic money, electronic currency or cyber cash.</li>
						<li align="justify">Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that can be exchanged on a blockchain network. It is a subset of digital currency. It is not issued by government entities. Think of cryptocurrency as tokens issued by private entities or groups that can be used to pay for items sold by those who also operate in the blockchain network. As of May 2021, market research website CoinMarketCap listed 4,993 different publicly traded cryptocurrencies.</li>
					</ul>
					<p align="justify">Blockchain is often referred as a distributed ledger that is designed to be secure and immune to hacking.</p>
					<p align="justify">It is a peer-peer network that does not require a central authority or database and, though should be considered separately, it is the technology that all cryptocurrency is based on. Bitcoin is the first and most commonly known cryptocurrency developed.</p>
					<p align="justify">However, since first created in 2009, the use of blockchain has expanded to other applications since Bitcoin's inception.</p>
					<p align="justify">Logistics companies use blockchain to track and monitor shipment of goods throughout the supplychain process. The banking and finance industry is making use of the technology to secure transactions. Multiple other industries such as the legal and entertainment professional are also using blockchain as the basis for smart contracts and for the transferring and protecting intellectual property.</p>
					<p align="justify">Blockchain works via a multistep process, which in simple terms happens as follows: </p>
					<ul>
						<li align="justify">An authorized participant inputs a transaction, which must be authenticated by the technology</li>
						<li align="justify">That action creates a block that represents that specific transaction or data</li>
						<li align="justify">The block is sent to every computer node in the network</li>
						<li align="justify">Authorized nodes verify the transaction and add the block to the existing blockchain. (Nodes in public blockchain networks are referred to as miners; they're typically paid for this task -- often in a process called Proof of Work, or PoW -- usually in the form of cryptocurrency.)</li>
						<li align="justify">The update is distributed across the network, which finalizes the transaction</li>
					</ul>
					<p align="justify">These steps take place in close to real time and involve a range of elements.</p>
					<p align="justify">A blockchain ledger consists of two types of records, individual transactions and blocks. The first block consists of a header and data that pertain to transactions taking place within a set time period. The block's timestamp is used to help create an alphanumeric string called a hash.</p>
					<p align="justify">After the first block has been created, each subsequent block in the ledger uses the previous block's hash to calculate its own hash.</p>
					<p align="justify">Before a new block can be added to the chain, its authenticity must be verified by a computational process called validation or consensus. At this point in the blockchain process, a majority of nodes in the network must agree the new block's hash has been calculated correctly. Consensus ensures that all copies of the blockchain distributed ledger share the same state.</p>
					<p align="justify">Once a block has been added, it can be referenced in subsequent blocks, but it cannot be changed.</p>
					<p align="justify">If someone attempts to swap out a block, the hashes for previous and subsequent blocks will also change and disrupt the ledger's shared state.</p>
					<p align="justify">When consensus is no longer possible, other computers in the network are aware that a problem has occurred and no new blocks will be added to the chain until the problem is solved.</p>
					<p align="justify">Typically, the block causing the error will be discarded and the consensus process will be repeated.</p>

				<h1>Robots - Vincent</h1>

			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>What does it do?</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p align="justify">The definition of a robot is differed by many roboticists, some believe that a robot can be defined by a thermostat, others might not. This definition is very dependent on how strict they are on what a robot is. However, all roboticists can agree on three attributes that a robot will have which is that it has a physical experience, is autonomous and is programmed by code.</p>
					<p align="justify">A robot’s purpose is to be able to alleviate/remove some of the harder tasks for people and make them much easier to perform. For example, a Roomba can go around the house and clean up dirt and dust automatically saving the trouble of cleaning up yourself. A new robot, Ai-Da was introduced in the last 3 years and was programmed by a group of programmers, artists and roboticists. Her purpose is to replicate an image onto a canvas using its camera and hands.</p>
					<p align="justify">Today, robots are used in many different places that could be dangerous or a chore to humans. Because of the places robots are being put in they need to be able to have certain uses such as: carry large amounts of weight, be able to identify different items and be able to act independently in different situations. In Future robots will develop tremendously from now and be able to make a difference in the way we live today. Some of the changes that may come will be seen in many factories as robots work autonomously and do heavy work. Roboticists are also trying to make robots easier to access so that the average person can easily implement them into their everyday lives. All of this will be possible as more and more people are trying to take up IT Jobs in the future and roboticists are also working together to develop and learn new things every day.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
					<p align="justify">With robots developing very quickly, there will be a huge impact on the loss of jobs in the workforce such as in factories, construction sites and retail. These three will be impacted the most as they are jobs that will be automated and replaced by robots. Robots are better for these jobs as they can lift heavier things, be programmed to do many things and don’t need to get paid. Although many jobs will be lost to these robots, new jobs will become in demand as there will likely be a need for maintenance for these robots where humans will do a quick checkup to look for any problems.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
					<p align="justify">This change in the future may cause my parents to lose their jobs, causing my family to go into a state where they will be jobless for months or years where money will become an issue. This will make us unable to pay for certain things such as internet which in turn will affect me taking the online courses. However, this may not be a problem as this change will not affect us as by the time jobs become automated, I will have already completed the course and am already looking for a job that may not be automated.</p>
					<p align="justify">The way this change will impact me in the future will be by adding more jobs and allowing me to have a wider range of jobs to apply for, making my chances of landing one easier. Most of my families and friends will have the same situation as me but some will also have a hard time following this change as most jobs will be lost and finding a non-automated job will require a skill that will be needed. Most of them will need to either improve or learn a new skill, meaning that when this change occurs a lot of people will have to go find higher education in order to keep up with job prerequisites. </p>
