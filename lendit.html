					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p></p>
					<p>LendIt aims to be the go-to app for all single-use community borrowing needs. It will provide a revenue stream for owners of seldom used items by providing a means to share these with others in their community looking to borrow them.</p>
					<div id="screenshot">

					</div>

<p></p>
					<p>These items will generally be of reasonable value where purchase for one-time use is not viable by potential borrowers. </p>
					<p>A key goal of LendIt is to provide a service that is simple to use. The user experience will a key decision point for any features and functionality deployed. Providing a platform that minimises end-user friction is crucial for attracting and retaining customers. </p>
					<p>LendIt will be developed utilising Agile Methodology to deploy a minimal viable product (MVP) and build on functionality with continual iterations and phased deployment.</p>
					<p> We envisage it will be built in four phases, with each phase consisting of the following stages: </p>
					<ol font="bold">
						<li align="justify">Frame: We uncover and prioritise desired functionality</li>
						<li align="justify">Discover: We discover, experiment, refine and test the functionality</li>
						<li align="justify">Develop: We build, test and deploy features early and often </li>
						<li align="justify">Measure: We celebrate the success or adjust, pivot or retire failures </li>
						<p></p>
					</ol>
					<p></p>
					<p>The initial MVP of Phase One will be built on iOS only and will allow LendIt to connect to people in their local community. The aim of Phase One is build and test the viability of the service and establish a solid foundation to continually build upon.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h2> Project Overview</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>Within this project the Everywhere Australia team intends to deliver a functioning LendIt V.1 application to introduce to the Australian market. LendIt is an iOS-based app which allows users in nearby locations to share, review and lend items to neighbours / fellow users of the app. The purpose of LendIt is to enable users to easily access products they may not want or need to purchase for one-time uses while allowing the owner to earn some extra cash for items they may not like or use as much. </p>

					</div>
					<p>This project will establish a basic version of the application, allowing users to begin to connect and enjoy the concept of LendIt. Our goal is once the version one has been rolled out and has a growing user base, we will then continue to develop LendIt by adding additional features in subsequent version releases. Ultimately, we will commercialise LendIt in version two, once a payment gateway has been implemented allowing us to generate profit from LendIt to reinvest into the app.<p/>
					<p>The motivation for LendIt stems from the current rise and continued dominance of social media and the sharing economy allowing communities to interact online for multiple purposes such as: advice, suggestions, social, purchasing, and borrowing items. For example, Facebook Marketplace has 1 billion active users per month, all of which engage in purchasing or hire transactions of goods and services. LendIt will follow this trend of using social platforms to engage with the local community, however, solely for the purpose of lending times rather than purchasing. (Leadsbridge, 2022) </p>
					<p>Currently there are various other applications which allow for the sale and hire of goods and services online. The previously mentioned Facebook Marketplace is a popular option to which most people already have accounts to Facebook so using this feature is no additional effort. There is also Car Next Door, which has just been bought out by Uber to be Uber Careshare which specifically focuses on local car rentals. Specifically for tool hire there is the likes of Active Hire and there is a growing want and need for clothes rentals to which you could find on many sites e.g. Glam Corner. </p>
					<p>Specifically, what will make LendIt stand out from its competitors is that this will be a ‘one stop shop’ where all types of products can be listed to lend. Similar to Facebook Marketplace, this will be locals lending from locals, ultimately building a sense of community in the early stages of the app releases. A point of difference to Facebook Marketplace is the LendIt app will be solely a platform for lending goods so people can use this for one specific use, unlike Facebook which can often get flooded with random spam.</p>
